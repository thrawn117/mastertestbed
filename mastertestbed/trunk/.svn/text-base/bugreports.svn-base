## Bugs in project

-- Point access is probably not thread safe. To fix this, each point object 
should have a lock object; when get() or set() is called, the call waits on the
lock before the read or write occurs.

-- The virtual devices don't handle errors gracefully.

-- The solenoid in the rtu pipe system doesn't have any delay from signal to
actuation. I.e. it opens immediately. Need to add a delay of about .5 seconds
for that to take effect.

-- The loop that runs proclogic has time determined by several different
factors. This works _right now_ but may cause issues in the future.
