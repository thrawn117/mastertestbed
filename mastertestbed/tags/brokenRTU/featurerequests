##Feature Requests
-- Implement more interface features for the vdevs and add an interface for the
simulator

-- Any time a point is written, it should be journaled. Journals could be a flat file, a pickle, or probably best a SQLite store.

-- Protocol interfaces: DNP3, Rockwell

-- Investigate refactoring the configuration files. "Flat is better than nested"

-- More robust unit tests for the ICS interfaces.

-- Add callbacks to the ics servers/clients to allow for overriding the default
behavior of point requests. This is how PLC's handle this behavior, and it would
let us model things like encrypting the lines.

-- The simulator communication interface needs some documentation.

-- The simulator needs an interface like the vdev has, and the vdev interface
needs more functionality. Pretty printing points, device status, configuration,
etc.

-- Virtual devices and the simulator need to be invoked with command line
options indicating which simulation and device to invoke

-- Implement logging errors in place of printing error messages to the console

-- vdev.py should be turned into a class so that configuration files and other
information isn't having to be passed into process control logic, etc...
